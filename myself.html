Hi, I'm Nur Qamarina binti Jamaludin. 
I am a Semester 4 student at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Cawangan Kedah, Kampus Sungai Petani studying Diploma in Library Informatics. 
Before this, I completed my school education at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan St. Anne's Convent, Kulim. 
I’ve always been passionate about learning and growing, even though I sometimes feel unsure about myself.
I am interested in solving problems and learning new things. 
I am also building my skills in coding and many more in my study course.
I love watching sunsets, spending time at the beach, and being surrounded by nature—it brings me peace and inspiration.
In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, listening to music and sometimes I watched kdrama too.
Feel free to connect with me by clicking the link below!</font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font size="5" color="#b03060">I started my education journey by attending kindergarten when I was 4 years old. 
The kindergarten I went to was called Tadika Klasik Ceria, a place where I began to learn and explore new things. 
I spent three years there, making my first memories of school life, and graduated when I was 6 years old. 
It was during this time that I started to develop my curiosity and love for learning, which has stayed with me ever since.</font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font size="5" color="#b03060">I continued my education journey by entering primary school, where I studied from Year 1 until Year 6. 
During those years, I didn’t really have any best friends because the people I considered close only treated me like a classmate. 
However, in Year 6, I met my true best friend, Marini Batrisyia binti Madzuri.
One of my favorite memories with her was when we went on a trip to Melaka and Kuala Lumpur. 
We had so much fun exploring new places and enjoying delicious food. The best part was having a sleepover during the trip, where we stayed up late, laughed a lot, and created unforgettable memories. 
Even now, we still keep in touch whenever we have free time, and I’m so grateful to have her as a friend.</font></td>

We became close friends in Form 2, and our bond grew stronger as we continued to support each other until Form 5.
Throughout those years, we shared so many unforgettable memories—studying together, laughing over silly things, and creating moments that I will always treasure. 
Even now, after finishing school, we still stay close and spend time together whenever we can. 
I’m truly grateful to have such wonderful friends who have been by my side through everything.</font></td>

My time at UiTM has been filled with wonderful experiences and the chance to meet amazing people.
During my Pre-Diploma, I met two incredible friends, Farah and Amira, who made that chapter of my life so enjoyable. 
As I continued my studies in Diploma, I was lucky to meet my wonderful roommates, Mekna and Aqhi, who have always been there for me, offering support and creating so many fun memories.
I also met amazing classmates like Awa, Aya, and many more. 
Together, we studied, shared laughter, and supported each other through challenges, making my university journey unforgettable. 
These friendships mean so much to me, and I truly cherish the moments we have spent together.
This time at UiTM has not only been about education but also about building friendships and creating memories that I will carry with me forever.</font></td>
