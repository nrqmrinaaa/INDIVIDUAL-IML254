<td><font size="3" color="#b03060">This is a photo of me with my parents, Jamaludin bin Saidon and Rosmah binti Abdullah, who mean the world to me. 
My father works as a self-employed worker, which gives him the flexibility to take care of me and my brother while also supporting our family. 
My mother works as an office planner, and she is one of the most hardworking and dedicated people I know.
Growing up, my father always made sure we were well taken care of, both physically and emotionally. 
Since he works on his own schedule, he spends more time with us, guiding and supporting us whenever we need him. 
He is patient, kind, and always willing to listen, making him the greatest father I could ever ask for. 
My mother, on the other hand, works tirelessly every day to provide for us. 
Even after long hours at work, she still finds time to cook delicious meals and ensure our home is filled with love and warmth.
Both of my parents are the reason I am where I am today. 
They have always prioritized our education, encouraging us to study hard and aim for a better future. 
Their sacrifices have shown me the true meaning of love, responsibility, and perseverance. 
No matter how tired they are, they always find a way to support us, whether it’s helping with schoolwork, listening to our stories, or simply being there when we need them.
My father is truly a great father, and my mother is the most dedicated and hardworking mom. 
To me, they are not just parents but also my role models, showing me the importance of hard work, love, and family. 
I will always be grateful to them for everything they have done, from giving us a good education to filling our lives with happiness and joy. 
They are, without a doubt, the best mom and dad in the world, and I feel so lucky to have them by my side.</font></td>

<td><font size="3" color="#b03060">This is a photo of me and my little brother, Muhammad Qayyum bin Jamaludin who is not just my sibling but also my best companion as we grew up together. 
Although there is a 6-year age difference between us, it never felt like a gap. 
From the time he was born, I always felt responsible for him, and as we grew older, our bond became even stronger.
Growing up, we shared so many happy memories together. 
Whether it was playing games, watching cartoons, or going on family trips, he was always by my side, making every moment fun and joyful. 
Despite being younger, he always managed to cheer me up whenever I was sad or stressed. 
His laughter, innocence, and playful personality brought so much happiness into my life.
As we got older, our relationship only got better. 
I would help him with his schoolwork, and he would always look up to me for guidance and support. 
At the same time, he taught me the importance of patience, understanding, and love. 
Even though we sometimes argued over small things, like who gets to choose the TV channel, we could never stay mad at each other for long.
I feel so lucky to have a little brother like him because he is not only my family but also my closest friend. 
We continue to grow and learn from each other every day. 
No matter where life takes us in the future, I know that our bond will remain unbreakable because we’ve built so many wonderful memories together.
Having a sibling like him has truly been one of the greatest blessings in my life.</font></td>

<td><font size="3" color="#b03060">This is a precious photo of me with my late grandmother, who holds a very special place in my heart. 
This photo was taken during a Hari Raya celebration, a moment that now feels even more meaningful because it captures her love and warmth. 
My grandmother was one of the most caring and loving people in my life, and I have so many beautiful memories with her.
I remember when I got chicken pox, she was the one who took care of me with so much patience and love. 
She made sure I was comfortable, applied ointments, and stayed by my side day and night to make sure I was okay. 
My grandmother always knew how to make me feel better, even when I was in pain. 
Her gentle touch and soothing words gave me strength during that time. 
She would cook my favorite meals and tell me stories to distract me from the discomfort. 
I can still remember how warm and safe I felt when she was around.
Unfortunately, she passed away when I was in Year 4, and it was one of the hardest moments in my life. 
Losing her felt like losing a big part of my heart. 
Even though she is no longer with us, I still carry all the beautiful memories of her in my mind.
This photo, taken on Hari Raya, reminds me of how special she made every celebration feel. 
Her presence brought joy to everyone around her. I miss her every day, but I know she is watching over me from above.
My grandmother will always remain in my heart, and her love will continue to guide me throughout my life.</font></td>

<td><font size="3" color="#b03060">This is a photo of me with my cousins from my mom’s side. 
Even though this photo doesn’t include all of us, it still holds special meaning because it reminds me of how close we are as a family. 
I grew up with my cousins since our grandparents’ house is close to ours, and we spent so much of our childhood together. 
Whether it was playing games, celebrating Hari Raya, or simply enjoying weekends, we always found reasons to be together.
Growing up with them felt like having extra siblings. 
Even though this photo is incomplete, the bond we share will always be whole. 
I’m truly grateful for all the memories we’ve created and the support we’ve given each other over the years. 
Moments like this remind me how lucky I am to have cousins who are more like best friends to me.</font></td>
